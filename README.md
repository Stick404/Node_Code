# NODE CODE!
This is an extremely WIP Minecraft mod that will be adding in Node Based coding into Minecraft for automation.
This will be done by building {TODO: Change the name} "Node Arrays," a 3-dimensional structure {TODO: Add a pictures}. Then, after they are built, there will be blue planes you can arrange and code nodes.
